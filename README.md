# modern-optimization-statistical-learning


This directory is for my research in modern optimization for statistical learning, where I did the following:

1- studied the relations between the behavior of first-order optimization algorithms and data conditioning, and the usage of relative continuity to solve non-Lipschitz non-smooth optimization problems.

2- I designed an accelerated stochastic gradient descent for the logistic regression problem in the case of a separable dataset, and proposed a sparse-promoting fast-converging solution to the lasso regression problem using an adapted proximal mirror descent.
